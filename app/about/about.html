            <p>
                I'm currently working as a software engineer at a booming start-up based out of Sarajevo called <a href="http://www.bookvar.co" target="_blank">@bookvar_co</a>. Hell bent on creating the most beautiful online learning platform ever.
            </p> 

            <p>
                I found that my passion is teaching. After my full-time job I teach JavaScript and MySQL at the  <a href="http://www.academy387.com/lecturers/adnan-rahic" target="_blank">@ACADEMY387</a>. A premium IT educational facility in Sarajevo.
            </p>

            <p>
                In my free time I volounteer as a campsite leader in my local <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/free.code.camp.sarajevo/" target="_blank">@freeCodeCamp</a> community. This is my way of giving back.
